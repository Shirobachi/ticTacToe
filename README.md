# timeIsTicking
This is project called Tic Tac Toe

## Tic Tac Toe
TicTacToe is a game for two players. At the begging I wrote API for different project, but since I wanted write something amazing I decide to expand API usage to little thing. Like you it went just amazing (If you think different just don't tell me this lied ðŸ˜›)

## Usage 
- Own API wrote in fastapi framework
- Vue.js3
- TailwindCSS
- Some components from web (you will find in the comments links to them)
